# JSConf 2015 Offline Schedule

Live at [http://nikc.org/jsconf-2015](http://nikc.org/jsconf-2015).

It's ugly but it does what it says on the tin.

Will be patche during the conference.

Pull requests welcome.

## Developing

`npm run watch` watches files in the `src` folder and rebuilds on change. No live update, sorry.

`npm run build` builds the project with `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Known bugs

- Does not take in account your computer's timezone setting, vs. local time
